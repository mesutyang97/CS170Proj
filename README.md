We use the combination of Greedy algorithm and simplified Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve this combination of KnapSack, Indepedent Set, and SAT problem.

Result: At the end of the competition, we, both freshmen at the time, ranked Number 3 out of the 350 teams in Berkeley's upper-division Algorithm class CS170.
