# CS170Proj
CS170 Project: An NP-Hard Problem Solver (Approximation Algorithm)
Contributor: Mesut (Xiaocheng) Yang and Jeff (Sichao) Xu


We use the combination of Greedy algorithm and simplified Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve this combination of KnapSack, Indepedent Set, and SAT problem.

Result: At the end of the competition, we ranked Number 3 out of the 350 teams in Berkeley's Algorithm class CS170.
